# Example Spectacles bot

This is an example Spectacles application that listens to messages and responds to pings.

> Note: This is not an example of how you should build a Discord application. Message content
> intents are privileged. Use interactions for application commands.

## Getting Started

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Replace "your token" with your Discord bot's token
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Send "ping" in a text channel that your Discord bot can respond to.
